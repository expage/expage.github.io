Log file for the expage 10Be and 26Al production rate calibration compilation

====================================================================================================

P-201912
* Calibration including shielding/production under water during uplift and updated calibration age
  for site 18 (Billingen, S Sweden).
* Calibration age uncertainty for sites 21-23 (Scotland) increased to 500 yr in light of data and
  views in Putnam et al. (2019) and Lowe et al. (2019).
* Eight boulder samples from the Baboon Lake moraine (Marcott et al. 2019) added to site 24.
* Previous site 25 (Puget Lowland) removed as one sample is located too far away from the other two
  samples to be grouped together. Previous site 26 (Rannoch Moor, Scotland) changed to site 25.
* Calibration age for site 25 (Rannoch Moor, Scotland) changed to 11760/11764 ± 500 yr in light of
  data presented in Lowe et al. (2019).
* A new site 26 added with data from the SP lava flow, Arizon, USA (Fenton et al. 2019).
* Recalculated weighted 10Be and 26Al concentrations and uncertainties for repeat measurements using
  the expected value method (Birch and Singh 2014).
* All production rates recalibrated with the expage-201912 calculator (including updated muon
  parameters).
* Production rate calibration using isostatic adjustment of atmospheric pressure added.
Updated global average 10Be reference production rate: 3.98 ± 0.22 atoms/g/yr.
Updated global average 26Al reference production rate: 28.44 ± 1.90 atoms/g/yr.
Global average isostatic adjustment 10Be reference production rate: 4.01 ± 0.23 atoms/g/yr.
Global average isostatic adjustment 26Al reference production rate: 28.41 ± 2.05 atoms/g/yr.

====================================================================================================

P-201902
Recalculated weighted 10Be and 26Al concentration uncertainties for repeat measurements using an
unbiased estimator. Added site 26 (10Be data; Putnam et al. 2019; Small and Fabel 2016). Production
rates recalibrated for the expage-201902 calculator. Recalibration yields slightly different
(although very similar) sample, site, and global production rates to the P-201810 data.
Updated global average 10Be reference production rate: 3.97 ± 0.22 atoms/g/yr.
Updated global average 26Al reference production rate: 28.47 ± 1.87 atoms/g/yr.

====================================================================================================

P-201810
Same calibration data as P-201806 but recalibrated for the expage-201810 calculator. Recalibration
yields very similar sample and site production rates to the P-201806 data and identical global
average.

====================================================================================================

P-201806
Same calibration data as P-201708 and same sample and site production rates calculated with the
expage-201806 calculator. Corrected 10Be production rate uncertainty (0.25 -> 0.22 atoms/g/yr) based
on root-mean-square deviation of all single sample production rates included in the well-clustered
sites.

====================================================================================================

P-201708
Same calibration data as P-201702 but input erosion rates changed (cm/yr -> mm/ka) to match the
expage-201708 calculator.

====================================================================================================

P-201702
* Changed 'Surface-ID' to 'Sample-ID' and gave separate IDs to separate samples from one surface so
  that similar Sample-ID indicate repeat measurements. This yields changes for calibration site 16
  (Kelly et al. 2015; Phillips et al. 2016b) where some samples are separate samples collected from
  one boulder. Changed erosion rates for Phillips et al. (2016b) samples to published values instead
  of Kelly et al. (2015) values.This reduces the site 10Be production rate by 0.02 atoms/g/yr and
  increases the site 26Al production rate by 0.06 atoms/g/yr.
* Added the five missing boulder/cobble samples to site 18 (Stroeven et al. 2015). This reduces the
  site 10Be production rate by 0.09 atoms/g/yr.
* Sampling year updated for Kaplan et al. (2011) and Martin et al. (2015) samples. This yields some
  minor (0.001 at/g/yr) production rate changes for individual samples but does not change the site
  production rates.
* 10Be and 26Al production rates calibrated for the expage-201702 calculator:
  10Be reference production rate: 3.98 ± 0.25 atoms/g/yr
  26Al reference production rate: 28.42 ± 1.87 atoms/g/yr
* Added production rate calibration 10Be data (71 measurements from 12 sites) and 26Al data (48
  measurements from 8 sites) to P-201702-origin (P-201702-refs and P-201702-comments updated as
  well) from sites not included in the global average dataset. These are samples from studies
  published before 2009 and from sites with less than three individual samples.

====================================================================================================

P-201610
Same calibration data as P-201606 but recalibrated for the expage-201610 calculator.
