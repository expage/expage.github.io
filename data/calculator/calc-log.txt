expage-201611: Fixed an error in the report part of get_al_be_erosion.m.

expage-201611: Added ' to lines 410 and 509 in prodcalib.m to fix a matrix error recognized in Octave version 4 (and probably
Matlab as well).

* Muon production changes:
  - Original solar modulation paramter SPhiInf used for P_mu_LSD.
  - Two changes in the negative muon calculations in P_mu_LSD (lines 105-125) to remove near-surface production artifacts.
  - Parameters fstar and sigma0 calibrated for the expage calculator based on the Beacon Heights data (Borchers et al. 2016;
    Marrero et al. 2016; Phillips et al. 2016) using mucalib.m. This calibration is based on the CRONUScalc method and it
    yields expage calculator values within the uncertainties of (but slightly different from) the CRONUScalc values. The code
    and data for muon parameter calibration is included in mucalib.zip.
* Muon production at depth interpolated from nine depth points based on simple age erosion depth for samples with erosion.
* Several changes in the expage, erosion, and prodcalib (previously named prodcalc) codes: Reorganization and improvements
  speeding up the calculations plus adding display of calculated values.
* Added code for calculating simple exposure and burial durations (and optionally plotting the banana diagram) from combined
  26Al and 10Be measurements, using a Monte Carlo simulation approach and a simplified time-constant spallation production.

New parameter (SPhimu = 416.492) used as 'SPhi' in P_mu_LSD (instead of SPhiInf) to mimic the muon production rate calibration
in CRONUScalc v 2.0 (Borchers et al. 2016; Marrero et al. 2016; Phillips et al. 2016).
In Lifton et al. (2014) SPhiInf = 462.036 and in CRONUScalc SPhiInf = 416.492.
This change induces a minimal (<2%) increase in the muon production.

10Be and 26Al exposure age calculator based on the CRONUS calculator (Balco et al. 2008) with some modifications:
* Nuclide-specific LSD spallation and muon production rate scaling based on simulated cosmic ray fluxes (Lifton et al. 2014).
* Time-dependent spallation production rate with reference production rates based on global average from calibration studies
  published 2009-2016.
* Time-constant muon production rate parameterization, including depth dependence for samples with an assumed erosion rate,
  based on Antarctica depth profile data (Borchers et al. 2016; Marrero et al. 2016; Phillips et al. 2016).
* Adjustment of the time-dependent production rate to the year of sampling (assuming a constant production since 2010).
* Atmospheric pressure based on sample elevation and ERA-40 re-analysis dataset ('std'), Antarctica best-fit interpolation
  ('ant') (Balco et al. 2008), or given directly ('pre') in hPa.
* Attenuation length for calculating the spallation production rate adjustments for sample thickness and erosion rate
  interpolated from atmospheric pressure and cutoff rigidity (Marrero et al. 2016).
