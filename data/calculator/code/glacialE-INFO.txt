Information for glacialE.m calculating erosion depth based on 10Be and/or 26Al data from sites with
a known or assumed ice cover history. The calculator is fixed by Jakob Heyman (jakob.heyman@gu.se)
2017-2019 with production rate (and other) calculations to a large degree based on the CRONUS
calculator (Balco et al. 2008) and the LSD production rate scaling (Lifton et al. 2014).


TO USE THE CALCULATOR:
1. Fix the input.txt file (see below).
2. Fix parameters in glacialE.m lines 21-102.
3. Run glacialE.m in Octave (for use in Matlab: try version 201810 of glacialE).
4. Output (see below) is saved in out-glacialE.txt


The calculator is based on the CRONUS calculator (Balco et al. 2008) with modifications:
* Nuclide-specific LSD spallation and muon production rate scaling based on simulated cosmic ray
  fluxes (Lifton et al. 2014).
* Time-dependent spallation production rate with reference production rates based on global average
  from calibration studies published 2009-2019 calibrated using prodrate.m.
* Time-constant muon production rate parameterization (modified to reduce near-surface artifacts)
  based on Antarctica depth profile data (Borchers et al. 2016; Marrero et al. 2016; Phillips et al.
  2016; Balco 2017) with fstar and sigma0 calibrated using muclib.m.
* Adjustment of the time-dependent production rate to the year of sampling (assuming a constant
  production since 2010).
* Atmospheric pressure based on sample elevation and ERA-40 re-analysis dataset ('std'), Antarctica
  best-fit interpolation ('ant') (Balco et al. 2008), or given directly ('pre') in hPa.
* Attenuation length for calculating the spallation production rate adjustments for sample thickness
  and erosion rate interpolated from atmospheric pressure and cutoff rigidity (Marrero et al. 2016).


INPUT INSTRUCTIONS:
The input is similar to the input for the CRONUS calcuator version 2.2, with the addition of
sampling year and deglaciation age (optional). Each row in input.txt is one sample and should
contain 16 or 17 columns with the following information:
1. Sample name - (strange characters may cause problems).
2. Latitude [DD (WGS84)] - North latitudes are positive. South latitudes are negative.
3. Longitude [DD (WGS84)] - East longitudes are positive. West longitudes are negative.
4. Elevation/pressure [m a.s.l. / hPa].
5. Elevation/pressure flag - std/ant/pre (ERA40 elev interpol/Antarctica elev/atmospheric pressure).
6. Sample thickness [cm].
7. Sample density [g/cm3].
8. Correction factor - Unitless factor used for topo/geom shielding correction (no shielding -> 1).
9. Erosion rate [mm/ka] - Non-glacial erosion rate used only in simple calc (simpleEcalc = 1).
10. 10Be concentration [atoms/g] - (if no 10Be measurement: use 0).
11. 10Be concentration uncertainty [atoms/g] - (if no 10Be measurement: use 0).
12. 10Be standardization - See make_consts_expage.m lines 34-38 for acceptable names and values.
13. 26Al concentration [atoms/g] - (if no 26Al measurement: use 0).
14. 26Al concentration uncertainty [atoms/g] - (if no 26Al measurement: use 0).
15. 26Al standardization - See make_consts_expage.m lines 41-42 for acceptable names and values.
16. Sampling year [CE].
17. Deglaciation [yr before sampling] - Time of last deglaciation (optional parameter).


glacialE.m SETTINGS:
In lines 21-102 there are a range of parameters and settings that controls the simulation. Here are
some brief explanations for these settings.
mt - Max time (years before 2010) for the start of the erosion simulation.
glacErate - Determines if using a glacial erosion rate (1) or fixed incremental erosion depth steps
            (0) at the end of each ice cover period for the glacial erosion to determine.
simpleEcalc - (1 or 0) Run simple glacial erosion calculation for single nuclides based on surface
              concentrations interpolated for a range of erosion rates/steps.
range1nucl - (1 or 0) Run simulation finding the range (within bounds) of nonglacial erosion,
             glacial erosion, and LR04 break values that can yield the measured 10Be and/or 26Al
             concentrations.
range2nucl - (1 or 0) Run simulation finding the range (within bounds) of nonglacial erosion,
             glacial erosion, and LR04 break values that can yield the combined measured 10Be and
             26Al concentrations.
burialdepth - Sample depth below surface (cm) at the time of sampling.
Fixed parameters for specific time period(s) (lines 36-43):
    Here specific values can be set for specific time periods for the non-glacial erosion and
    glacial erosion. The values set here overrides the values set in input or the values to find.
    Various values for various time periods can be set by using multiple rows in the corresponding
    time vectors (tv) and parameters. For the glacial erosion parameters, both fixed glacial erosion
    rates and glacial erosion incremental steps can be set and these are independent of glacErate
    set above.
Fixed ice-cover and icefree for specific time period(s) (lines 45-48)
    Here specific periods with ice cover (fix_ice) and ice-free periods (fix_nonice) can be set that
    overrides the ice cover periods and ice-free periods determined by the LR04 values and the
    optional input deglaciation age.
Parameters for simpleEcalc (lines 50-53 - only relevant if simpleEcalc = 1)
LR04ice - Break value (per mil) for the glacialE_LR04.txt record to determine ice cover periods.
simpleEcalcunc - (1 or 0) Plot uncertainty lines in the erosion plots.

Punc - (1 or 0) Add production rate uncertainty to the 10Be and/or 26Al measurements as a simple
       way to include this uncertainty in the calculations.

OUTPUT INFORMATION:
The calculator can plot various data plus saves an output file out-glacialE.txt.
For simpleEcalc = 1, the output contains the erosion rate/step plus positive and negative uncertainty
(including production rate uncertainty), plus the full erosion depth at 100 ka and 1 Ma (if <=mt).
For range1nucl = 1 and/or range2nucl = 1, the output contains possible min and max values for the
parameters glacial erosion, non-glacial erosion, and LR04 break values, plus the full erosion depth
at 100 ka and 1 Ma (if <=mt).
Samples with 0 concentration yield '-' in the output.
If all input 10Be concentration/uncertainty are 0/0 no 10Be erosion data will be saved.
If all input 26Al concentration/uncertainty are 0/0 no 26Al erosion data will be saved.
