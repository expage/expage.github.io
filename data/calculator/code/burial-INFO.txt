Information for burial.m (version 201912) calculating simple exposure and burial durations for
combined 10Be and 26Al measurements. The calculator is fixed by Jakob Heyman (jakob.heyman@gu.se)
2015-2019 mainly based on the CRONUS calculator (Balco et al. 2008) and the LSD production rate
scaling (Lifton et al. 2014).


TO USE THE CALCULATOR:
1. Fix the input.txt file (see below).
2. Make choices in lines 41-46.
3. Run burial.m in Octave or Matlab.
4. Simple exposure and burial durations (yr) are saved in out-burial.txt


The calculator is based on the CRONUS calculator (Balco et al. 2008) with some modifications:
* Nuclide-specific LSD spallation and muon production rate scaling based on simulated cosmic ray
  fluxes (Lifton et al. 2014).
* Time-constant spallation production rate based on RcEst and SPhiInf values with expage global
  average reference production rates. Note that this is different from the expage exposure age
  calculator using a time-dependent spallation production rate. As the 26/10 exposure and burial
  uncertainties are generally large, the error introduced by this simplification is insignificant.
* Time-constant muon production rate parameterization (modified to reduce near-surface artifacts)
  based on Antarctica depth profile data (Borchers et al. 2016; Marrero et al. 2016; Phillips et al.
  2016) with fstar and sigma0 calibrated using muclib.m.
* Atmospheric pressure based on sample elevation and ERA-40 re-analysis dataset ('std'), Antarctica
  best-fit interpolation ('ant') (Balco et al. 2008), or given directly ('pre') in hPa.
* Attenuation length for calculating the spallation production rate adjustments for sample thickness
  and erosion rate interpolated from atmospheric pressure and cutoff rigidity (Marrero et al. 2016).
* A simple history is assumed with one or two of the following scenarios:
  1. (exposure_burial = 1) Constant duration of exposure at the surface followed by full burial.
  2. (erosion_burial = 1) Constant erosion rate followed by full burial.
  To get the exposure duration and/or the erosion rate and the associated burial duration the 10Be
  and 26Al concentrations are calculated in an iterative approach zooming in on the exposure/erosion
  and burial scenario that yields the measured 10Be and 26Al concentrations. Samples with 26/10
  ratios above the simple exposure/constant erosion line yield negative burial durations. To
  estimate uncertainties a Monte Carlo simulation approach (100000 mc runs) is adopted including the
  10Be and 26Al concentration uncertainties (internal uncertainty - line 28) and the reference
  production rate uncertainties (external uncertainty - line 27).


INPUT INSTRUCTIONS:
The input is given in the file input.txt and the format can be one of two options. For both options
the data for each sample is specified in one row (rows can be commented out with '%').

Option 1:
Similar input as for the CRONUS calcuator version 2 (Balco et al. 2008) with the addition of
sampling year. The input should contain 15 columns with the following information:
1. Sample name - (strange characters may cause problems).
2. Latitude [DD (WGS84)] - North latitudes are positive. South latitudes are negative.
3. Longitude [DD (WGS84)] - East longitudes are positive. West longitudes are negative.
4. Elevation/pressure [m a.s.l. / hPa].
5. Elevation/pressure flag - std/ant/pre (ERA40 elev interpol/Antarctica elev/atmospheric pressure).
6. Sample thickness [cm].
7. Sample density [g/cm3].
8. Correction factor - Unitless factor used for topo/geom shielding correction (no shielding -> 1).
9. 10Be concentration [atoms/g] - (if no 10Be measurement: use 0).
10. 10Be concentration uncertainty [atoms/g] - (if no 10Be measurement: use 0).
11. 10Be standardization - See make_consts_expage.m lines 34-38 for acceptable names and values.
12. 26Al concentration [atoms/g] - (if no 26Al measurement: use 0).
13. 26Al concentration uncertainty [atoms/g] - (if no 26Al measurement: use 0).
14. 26Al standardization - See make_consts_expage.m lines 41-42 for acceptable names and values.
15. Sampling year [CE].

Option 2:
Data in columns with row 1 specifying the data of each columns. The following specifiers are
allowed (the order of the data/columns is irrelevant):
sample - Sample name - (strange characters may cause problems).
lat - Latitude [DD (WGS84)] - North latitudes are positive. South latitudes are negative.
long - Longitude [DD (WGS84)] - East longitudes are positive. West longitudes are negative.
elv - Elevation/pressure [m a.s.l. / hPa].
Pflag - Elevation/pressure flag - std/ant/pre (see above). If not specified std will be used.
thick - Sample thickness [cm].
dens - Sample density [g/cm3].
shield - Correction factor - Unitless factor used for topo/geom shielding correction.
erosion - Erosion rate [mm/ka]. Not used in calculator.
N10 - 10Be concentration [atoms/g].
N10unc - 10Be concentration uncertainty [atoms/g].
std10 - 10Be standardization - See make_consts_expage.m lines 34-38 for acceptable names and values.
N26 - 26Al concentration [atoms/g].
N26unc - 26Al concentration uncertainty [atoms/g].
std26 - 26Al standardization - See make_consts_expage.m lines 41-42 for acceptable names and values.
samplingyr - Sampling year [CE].
pressure - Atmospheric pressure [hPa] - If pressure is included, data in elv is not used.


OUTPUT INFORMATION:
The calculator saves simple exposure plus burial durations and/or constant erosion rates plus burial
durations in the file out-burial.txt.
If exposure_burial = 1 (line 23 in burial.m): simple exposure and burial durations (yr).
If erosion_burial = 1 (line 24 in burial.m): simple erosion rates (mm/ka) and burial durations (yr).
Samples with no simple exposure/erosion solution yield '-' in the output.
Samples with 10Be and/or 26Al concentration = 0 yield '-' in the output.
If normNout = 1 (line 32 in burial.m), the calculator will also save sample concentrations and
uncertainties normalized to the sample production rate (for later plotting).
