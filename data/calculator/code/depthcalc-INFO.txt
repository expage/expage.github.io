Information for depthcalc.m and depthcalcET.m calculating 10Be and 26Al depth profile exposure ages.
The calculator is fixed by Jakob Heyman (jakob.heyman@gu.se) 2015-2017 mainly based on the CRONUS
calculator (Balco et al. 2008) and the LSD production rate scaling (Lifton et al. 2014).

depthcalc.m:
Depth profile calculator for calculating the best-fit 10Be and/or 26Al exposure age.

depthcalcET.m
Depth profile calculator for calculating the best-fit 10Be and/or 26Al erosion rate / exposure age
chi-square domain for a range of defined erosion rates and exposure durations.


TO USE THE CALCULATORS (depthcalc.m / depthcalcET.m):
1. Run depthcalc.m / depthcalcET.m in Octave or Matlab.
2. Best-fit exposure ages and plots (if on) are displayed.


General information for both calculators:
* Nuclide-specific LSD spallation and muon production rate scaling based on simulated cosmic ray
  fluxes (Lifton et al. 2014) similar to the other expage scripts.
* Time-dependent spallation production rate with reference production rates based on global average
  from calibration studies published 2009-2016 calibrated using prodrate.m.
* Time-constant muon production rate parameterization (modified to reduce near-surface artifacts),
  including depth dependence for samples with an assumed erosion rate, based on Antarctica depth
  profile data (Borchers et al. 2016; Marrero et al. 2016; Phillips et al. 2016; Balco 2017) with
  fstar and sigma0 calibrated using muclib.m.
* Adjustment of the time-dependent production rate to the year of sampling (assuming a constant
  production since 2010).
* Atmospheric pressure based on sample elevation and ERA-40 re-analysis dataset ('std'), Antarctica
  best-fit interpolation ('ant') (Balco et al. 2008), or given directly ('pre') in hPa.
* Attenuation length for calculating the spallation production rate adjustments for sample thickness
  and erosion rate interpolated from atmospheric pressure and cutoff rigidity (Marrero et al. 2016).

depthcalc.m:
* Depth profile exposure age calculated using chi-square minimization of simulated and measured
  sample concentrations (10Be and/or 26Al).
* Internal uncertainty based on best-fit individual sample exposure ages and uncertainties (weighted
  average). Reference production rate uncertainty added in quadrature to derive external
  uncertainty.

depthcalcET.m:
* Calculation of 10Be and/or 26Al concentration reduced chi-square values for a mesh of erosion
  rates and exposure ages defined by Emin-Emax and Tmin-Tmax (number of grid points defined by
  ETgrid at line 31).
* Spline interpolation of the chi-square matrix (to 1000 x 1000 points) to smooth the surface,
  identification of the minimum chi-square value and associated E and T, and plotting of that best-
  fit point plus contours for the minimum reduced chi-square value plus the values in vector cl
  (line 261).


INPUT INSTRUCTIONS:
The input is similar to the input for the CRONUS calcuator version 2 (Balco et al. 2008), with
sample thickness changed to to mid-point sample depth, changed unit for erosion rate, and the
addition of sampling year. Each row in input.txt is one sample and should contain 16 columns with
the following information:
1. Sample name - (strange characters may cause problems).
2. Latitude [DD (WGS84)] - North latitudes are positive. South latitudes are negative.
3. Longitude [DD (WGS84)] - East longitudes are positive. West longitudes are negative.
4. Elevation/pressure [m a.s.l. / hPa].
5. Elevation/pressure flag - std/ant/pre (ERA40 elev interpol/Antarctica elev/atmospheric pressure).
6. Sample thickness [cm].
7. Sample density [g/cm3].
8. Correction factor - Unitless factor used for topo/geom shielding correction (no shielding -> 1).
9. Erosion rate [mm/ka]. NOTE: other unit than in the CRONUS calculator (not used in depthcalcET.m).
10. 10Be concentration [atoms/g] - (if no 10Be measurement: use 0).
11. 10Be concentration uncertainty [atoms/g] - (if no 10Be measurement: use 0).
12. 10Be standardization - See make_al_be_consts.m lines 51-55 for acceptable names and values.
13. 26Al concentration [atoms/g] - (if no 26Al measurement: use 0).
14. 26Al concentration uncertainty [atoms/g] - (if no 26Al measurement: use 0).
15. 26Al standardization - See make_al_be_consts.m lines 58-59 for acceptable names and values.
16. Sampling year [CE].

Only in depthcalcET.m (rows 16-23) =================================================================
Tmin - Minimum exposure age to test (yr before sampling).
Tmax - Maximum exposure age to test (yr before sampling).
Emin - Minimum erosion rate to test (mm/ka).
Emax - Maximum erosion rate to test (mm/ka).
ETgrid - Number of E and T points to make an ET mesh for testing the fit to measured concentrations.

OUTPUT depthcalc.m:
The calculator displays the best-fit exposure age (internal uncertainty in parenthesis), reduced
chi-square value, and associated P-value. If plotting is on, a pÄºot with individual sample
concentrations (red points) and best-fit depth profile concentration (black line) is displayed for
the 10Be and/or 26Al data. No output file is saved.

OUTPUT depthcalcET.m:
The calculator displays the range of exposure duration (T-range) and erosion (E-range), the best-fit
erosion (E), exposure age (T), reduced chi-square value (Rchi2), and associated P-value for the 10Be
and/or 26Al data. A plot with the best-fit E and T value (point) and contour lines for the minimum
reduced chi-square value plus [0.05 0.5 1.0 2.0] (defined by cl at line 261) is displayed for the
10Be and/or 26Al data. No output file is saved.
