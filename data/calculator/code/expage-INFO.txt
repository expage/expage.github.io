Information for expage.m (version 201912) calculating 10Be and 26Al exposure ages.
The calculator is fixed by Jakob Heyman (jakob.heyman@gu.se) 2015-2019 mainly based on the CRONUS
calculator (Balco et al. 2008) and the LSD production rate scaling (Lifton et al. 2014).


TO USE THE CALCULATOR:
1. Fix the input.txt file (see below).
2. Run expage.m in Octave (Matlab might work as well).
3. 10Be and/or 26Al exposure ages (yr) are saved in out-expages.txt.


The calculator is based on the CRONUS calculator (Balco et al. 2008) with some modifications:
* Nuclide-specific LSD spallation and muon production rate scaling based on simulated cosmic ray
  fluxes (Lifton et al. 2014).
* Time-dependent spallation production rate with reference production rates based on global average
  from calibration studies published 2009-2019 calibrated using prodrate.m.
* Time-constant muon production rate parameterization (modified to reduce near-surface artifacts),
  including depth dependence for samples with an assumed erosion rate, based on Antarctica depth
  profile data (Borchers et al. 2016; Marrero et al. 2016; Phillips et al. 2016; Balco 2017) with
  fstar and sigma0 calibrated using muclib.m.
* Adjustment of the time-dependent production rate to the year of sampling (assuming a constant
  production since 2010).
* Atmospheric pressure based on sample elevation and ERA-40 re-analysis dataset ('std'), Antarctica
  best-fit interpolation ('ant') (Balco et al. 2008), or given directly ('pre') in hPa.
* Attenuation length for calculating the spallation production rate adjustments for sample thickness
  and erosion rate interpolated from atmospheric pressure and cutoff rigidity (Marrero et al. 2016).


INPUT INSTRUCTIONS:
The input is given in the file input.txt and the format can be one of two options. For both options
the data for each sample is specified in one row (rows can be commented out with '%').

Option 1:
Similar input as for the CRONUS calcuator version 2 (Balco et al. 2008), with changed unit for
erosion rate and the addition of sampling year. The input should contain 16 columns with the
following information:
1. Sample name - (strange characters may cause problems).
2. Latitude [DD (WGS84)] - North latitudes are positive. South latitudes are negative.
3. Longitude [DD (WGS84)] - East longitudes are positive. West longitudes are negative.
4. Elevation/pressure [m a.s.l. / hPa].
5. Elevation/pressure flag - std/ant/pre (ERA40 elev interpol/Antarctica elev/atmospheric pressure).
6. Sample thickness [cm].
7. Sample density [g/cm3].
8. Correction factor - Unitless factor used for topo/geom shielding correction (no shielding -> 1).
9. Erosion rate [mm/ka]. NOTE: different unit than in the CRONUS calculator.
10. 10Be concentration [atoms/g] - (if no 10Be measurement: use 0).
11. 10Be concentration uncertainty [atoms/g] - (if no 10Be measurement: use 0).
12. 10Be standardization - See make_consts_expage.m lines 34-38 for acceptable names and values.
13. 26Al concentration [atoms/g] - (if no 26Al measurement: use 0).
14. 26Al concentration uncertainty [atoms/g] - (if no 26Al measurement: use 0).
15. 26Al standardization - See make_consts_expage.m lines 41-42 for acceptable names and values.
16. Sampling year [CE].

Option 2:
Data in columns with row 1 specifying the data of each columns. The following specifiers are
allowed (the order of the data/columns is irrelevant):
sample - Sample name - (strange characters may cause problems).
lat - Latitude [DD (WGS84)] - North latitudes are positive. South latitudes are negative.
long - Longitude [DD (WGS84)] - East longitudes are positive. West longitudes are negative.
elv - Elevation/pressure [m a.s.l. / hPa].
Pflag - Elevation/pressure flag - std/ant/pre (see above). If not specified std will be used.
thick - Sample thickness [cm].
dens - Sample density [g/cm3].
shield - Correction factor - Unitless factor used for topo/geom shielding correction.
erosion - Erosion rate [mm/ka]. If not specified a zero erosion rate is assumed.
N10 - 10Be concentration [atoms/g].
N10unc - 10Be concentration uncertainty [atoms/g].
std10 - 10Be standardization - See make_consts_expage.m lines 34-38 for acceptable names and values.
N26 - 26Al concentration [atoms/g].
N26unc - 26Al concentration uncertainty [atoms/g].
std26 - 26Al standardization - See make_consts_expage.m lines 41-42 for acceptable names and values.
samplingyr - Sampling year [CE].
pressure - Atmospheric pressure [hPa] - If pressure is included, data in elv is not used.
isostP - String specifying the isostatic adjustment method for atmospheric pressure adjustments.
For isostP the following strings can be used:
ICE6G - Isostatic adjustment using the global ICE6G data (Argus et al. 2014; Peltier et al. 2015).
ANU2017 - Isostatic adjustment using the data from Lambeck et al. (2017) for North America.
PD2015 - Isostatic adjustment using the PÃ¥sse and Daniels (2015) data for Fennoscandia.
filename - Name of file with isostatic adjustment data (tv, delv or shoreline, and yr0).
If a sample has the string '-' for isostP or isostsubm, no isostatic adjustment is carried out.


OUTPUT INFORMATION:
The calculator saves 10Be and/or 26Al exposure ages in the file out-expage.txt.
Exposure ages (yr) are saved with external and internal uncertainties (Balco et al. 2008).
Fully saturated samples yield exposure age 10000000 (10Be) and 6000000 (26Al).
Samples with 0/0 concentration/uncertainty yield '-' in the output.
If all input 10Be concentration/uncertainty are 0/0 no 10Be exposure ages are saved.
If all input 26Al concentration/uncertainty are 0/0 no 26Al exposure ages are saved.


PLOTTING:
Plotting of point ages and/or probability density curves can be set in lines 20-21.
Setting plotpointages = 1 plots point ages with external uncertainty (separate plots for 10Be/26Al).
Setting plotprobdens = 1 plots individual sample probability density curves (using internal
uncertainty) plus a summed probability density curve and a weighted mean age with propagated
reference production rate uncertainty if more than one sample.
